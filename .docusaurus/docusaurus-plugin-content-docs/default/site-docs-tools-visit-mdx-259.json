  "description": "Much like Inertia.js' Protocol, you can use the visit(url, options = { ... }) function to navigate to a new page that uses Laravext. This creates a smooth SPA experience, as it doesn't reload the page. If the version of the application changes between visits, or if the view set for that route is different from the one that was previously loaded, an usual page visit will happen.",
