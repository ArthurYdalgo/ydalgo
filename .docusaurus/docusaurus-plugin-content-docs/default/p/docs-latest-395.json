Each directory will be, in most cases, a url segment that might be a page. For a directory to be a page it must contain a page.(jsx|tsx|js|ts|vue|ts|js) file, and other file conventions from Next.js are available. Every time an automagically generated route is accessed, the application will load the default root view (which can be overwritten for a specific route, if necessary). This route view might extend a layout or not, depending on your needs, and must contain a @nexus blade directive. The createLaravextApp/createLaravextSsrApp function at the app.(js/ts/jsx/tsx)/ssr.(js/ts/jsx/tsx) (or whoever you named these files) will then look for every nexus in the DOM (although it'd usually only make sense to have one), and render the page component of that URL path.","sidebar":"docs"},"configuration":{"id":"configuration","title":"Configuration","description":"As mentioned in the Quick Start section, you can publish the configuration file of Laravext by running the following command:","sidebar":"docs"},"examples/layout":{"id":"examples/layout","title":"Layout","description":"This is an example of a layout file convention.
